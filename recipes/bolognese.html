    <h2>A simple Bolognese recipe for excellent chunky pasta sauce with beef, pork, lots of vegetables, and tons of flavor.</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut√© onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. </li>
        <li> Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li> Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li> Serve sauce over hot pasta. </li>
    </ol>
